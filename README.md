## STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
#### This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical stock data, we can develop models to forecast future stock prices. In this README, we will outline the steps to run the stock market prediction model.
##### 1)Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
##### 2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset's structure and characteristics. Use visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand key statistics and trends in the data.
##### 3)Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. This could involve lagging features to capture past trends or creating moving averages to smooth out noise in the data.
##### 4)Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, decision trees, or other regression models, to predict stock prices. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets, and use the training set to train the model and the validation set to tune hyperparameters.
##### 5)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. Compare the performance of different models to choose the best one for predicting stock prices.


## CRT
#### This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
### Data Preprocessing:
##### 1)Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration.
##### 2)Handle missing values using imputation or removal.
##### 3)Handle outliers using trimming, transformation, or capping.
##### 4)Normalize or standardize the features.
### Feature Selection and Engineering:
##### 1)Identify relevant features using statistical tests, correlation analysis, or feature importance.
##### 2)Explore creating new features or transformations.
### Machine Learning Model (SVM):
##### 1)Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
##### 2)Implement an SVM model, experimenting with different kernels and hyperparameters.
##### 3)Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance.
##### 4)Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.


## SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS
#### This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data to determine the sentiment expressed in the text (positive, negative, or neutral). Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that can be applied to various types of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and product feedback.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Tokenization: Splitting the text into words or tokens.
   - Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or root form.
   - Removing stopwords: Removing common words that do not contribute to the sentiment.

2. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Converting text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

3. **Model Selection:** 
   - Choosing a suitable machine learning model for sentiment analysis, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** 
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
   - Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance on the testing set.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** 
   - Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance.

6. **Evaluation Metrics:** 
   - Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance.
