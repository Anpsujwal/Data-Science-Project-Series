## STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
#### This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical stock data, we can develop models to forecast future stock prices. In this README, we will outline the steps to run the stock market prediction model.
##### 1)Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
##### 2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset's structure and characteristics. Use visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and scatter plots to understand key statistics and trends in the data.
##### 3)Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. This could involve lagging features to capture past trends or creating moving averages to smooth out noise in the data.
##### 4)Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, decision trees, or other regression models, to predict stock prices. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets, and use the training set to train the model and the validation set to tune hyperparameters.
##### 5)Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. Compare the performance of different models to choose the best one for predicting stock prices.


## CRT
#### This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnoses based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
### Data Preprocessing:
##### Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration.
##### Handle missing values using imputation or removal.
##### Handle outliers using trimming, transformation, or capping.
##### Normalize or standardize the features.
#### Feature Selection and Engineering:
##### Identify relevant features using statistical tests, correlation analysis, or feature importance.
##### Explore creating new features or transformations.
#### Machine Learning Model (SVM):
##### Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
##### Implement an SVM model, experimenting with different kernels and hyperparameters.
##### Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance.
##### Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
